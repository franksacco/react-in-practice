# Setup for the tutorial on React

The in-depth lessons on React will consist in two parts: one based on the concepts and theory behind React, and one more focused on a practical approach on the JavaScript framework and how to structure an application based on it.

It is recommended that you bring your laptop and complete the following steps before the lesson:
- Install an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is strongly suggested.
- Setup an environment with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (version 18 is suggested). You can accomplish this in two ways:
    - Manually download and install Node.js on your system.
    - Use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) for the application. In this case your project and all its dependencies are isolated and won't affect your host system. Your requirements are [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Visual Studio Code (further details will be given during the class).
